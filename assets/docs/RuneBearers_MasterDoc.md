### **‚úÖ Mandatory Validation Checklist**

**Before submitting ANY challenge, verify:**

1. **JSON Structure:**
   - [ ] Day number matches `"day{N}"` format
   - [ ] All required fields present (realm, room, icon, artwork, story)
   - [ ] Proper nesting: `irlChallenge` and `mathChallenge` objects

2. **Rune Integration:**
   - [ ] `baseRune` matches schedule OR is `null`
   - [ ] `runeIcon` matches rune OR is `null` 
   - [ ] `finalMessage` present if rune day (for reward prompt)

3. **Language Complexity:**
   - [ ] **Wells:** 6-10 word sentences, advanced vocabulary allowed
   - [ ] **Rou:** 4-6 word sentences, common sight words only

4. **IRL Challenge Structure:**
   - [ ] `type` matches available options per player
   - [ ] `content` object matches type structure exactly
   - [ ] Instructions are step-by-step arrays

5. **Math Challenge Structure:**
   - [ ] Missions numbered sequentially starting at 1
   - [ ] Each mission has required fields: category, title, story, question, answer
   - [ ] HTML formatting uses `<strong>` tags appropriately
   - [ ] Answer is numeric or in `acceptedAnswers` array

### **üö´ Common Error Prevention**

**These WILL break the system:**
- Missing `finalMessage` on rune reward days
- Wrong `irlChallenge.type` for player (piano for Rou, shoeTie for Wells)
- Math missions not numbered 1, 2, 3...
- Language complexity mismatch (complex words for Rou)
- Missing required JSON fields
- Inconsistent emoji usage
- Non-numeric answers without `acceptedAnswers` array

**Theme Application Rules:**
- **Wells:** Orange theme auto-applied, sun/fire/warm imagery preferred
- **Rou:** Blue theme auto-applied, moon/ice/cool imagery preferred
- System handles theme styling automatically based on player

**Project Type:**  
Educational Dungeon Crawler ‚Äî Gamified Summer Challenge

**Primary Users:**  
- Wells (Age 7, entering 2nd grade)
- Rou (Age 6, entering 1st grade)

**Platform:**  
- Standalone web app (HTML/JS/CSS)
- Client-side only, runs via GitHub commits
- Local save state (`localStorage`) - **CRITICAL:** No localStorage/sessionStorage in artifacts due to Claude.ai restrictions
- Played on Mac Mini touchscreen
- Save state is device-specific

**Project Dates:**  
- Start: June 2, 2025  
- End: July 25, 2025  
- Duration: 8 weeks (40 weekdays)
- Total Rooms: 40 rooms per player (80 total)

---

## üìÖ Schedule Rules & Structure

### **Core Schedule Rules**
- **Weekdays Only:** New room unlocks Monday-Friday
- **Weekends:** Catch-up days (no automatic unlocks)
- **Sync Rule:** Boys progress in lockstep (within 1 room of each other)
- **Admin Override:** Parents can manually unlock rooms for travel/emergencies

### **Room Structure per Realm**
Each realm has 10 rooms:
- **Rooms 1-4:** Exploration
- **Room 5:** Sub-Boss encounter
- **Rooms 6-9:** Exploration  
- **Room 10:** Boss encounter (bold formatting)

### **Special Encounters**
- **Sub-Bosses:** Days 5, 15, 25, 35
- **Bosses:** Days 10, 20, 30, 40
- **Chicken Jockey Arenas:** 
  - Wells: Day 9 (6/12) - Big loot
  - Rou: Day 29 (7/10) - Big loot

### **IRL Task Distribution**
- **60% of weekdays** have IRL tasks
- **Rule:** When both boys have tasks on same day, tasks must be different

---

## üèó Room Format Standard

Each room follows this structure:

```markdown
## [Player Name] ‚Äî Day [X]  
Realm: [Realm Name]  
Room: [Room Name]  

[Short lore: 2-3 sentences to set the scene]

To solve this room:
1. [Task or puzzle step]
2. [Optional additional step]
3. [Optional additional step]

[Outcome text: "You find the ___ rune." OR alternate success message]
```

### **Design Guidelines**
- Use "you" phrasing for player POV narration
- Tie room problems to realm's unique flavor
- Reference prior lore breadcrumbs for story continuity
- Keep sensory details minimal but evocative
- Maintain question continuity & resource tracking across steps

### **Language Complexity**
- **Wells (age 7):** 6-10 word sentences, vocabulary like "glimmer," "murmur"
- **Rou (age 6):** 4-6 word sentences, common sight words only

### **Journaling Notes**
- Journals used **only for working notes** during current challenges
- **No future recall mechanics** - journaling for puzzle continuity removed
