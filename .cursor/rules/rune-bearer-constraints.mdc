# Rune Bearer Project Rules

## Core Principle
Carefully reflect on the quality and completeness of your work against the specific requirements given. Ensure your implementation fully addresses what was requested without adding unrequested features or changes.

## Technical Constraints
- **NO localStorage/sessionStorage** - Browser restriction for this deployment
- Vanilla HTML/CSS/JavaScript only (no frameworks)
- Client-side only (no backend dependencies)
- Touchscreen-friendly for Mac Mini deployment

## Game Mechanics (Do Not Modify Without Permission)
- 8-week challenge: June 2 - July 25, 2025 (40 weekdays)
- Wells and Rou stay within 1 room of each other (synchronized)
- Only one child gets IRL task per day, never both
- Week 1 structure is locked/unchangeable
- Boss battles: Days 10, 20, 30, 40 (bold formatting)
- Sub-bosses: Days 5, 15, 25, 35 (colored background)
- Chicken Jockey: Wells Day 9, Rou Day 29 (bold + light green)

## Content Guidelines
- **Wells (age 7)**: 6-10 word sentences, vocabulary like "glimmer," "murmur"
- **Rou (age 6)**: 4-6 word sentences, common sight words only
- Each realm has distinct environmental flavor
- Sequential problems must reference previous steps ("You now hold X shards")
- Companions (Flint/Ferrin) provide contextual hints only

## File Access Restrictions
- Do not access or modify game schedule files unless explicitly requested
- Room content files should follow established narrative patterns
- Maintain existing CSS class naming conventions
